# ppconstants

Physical and mathematical constants, in POST Python.

`ppconstants` reimplements `scipy.constants` in
[POST Python](https://github.com/openteams-ai/postpython) — every kernel is
fully-typed Python that runs under the standard CPython interpreter **and**
compiles ahead-of-time to native code (a plain C shared library and a NumPy
ufunc extension module) with the POST Python reference compiler.

Status: **Planning** — this repository is scaffolding, ready for an agent or
contributor to claim. It is part of the
[PostSciPy effort](https://github.com/openteams-ai/postpython/blob/main/postscipy-roadmap.md)
to rebuild SciPy one subpackage at a time as the compiler's proving ground.

Primary compiler pressure this package generates: module-level constants at scale; cross-module constant imports.

## Start here

1. Read the [POST Python spec](https://github.com/openteams-ai/postpython/blob/main/docs/spec.md)
   and the [PostSciPy roadmap](https://github.com/openteams-ai/postpython/blob/main/postscipy-roadmap.md)
   (package map, working rules, capability matrix).
2. Copy the layout of [ppspecial](https://github.com/openteams-ai/ppspecial),
   the exemplar package: `ppconstants/` sources, `tests/`,
   `scripts/build_native.py`, `scripts/build_ext.py`, a pixi workspace with
   `test` / `build-native` / `build-ext` tasks, a git dependency on
   postpython, and a `ROADMAP.md` tracking targets and upstream requests.
3. Start with a slice from "Compiles today" below; land it as a small PR with
   tests in both execution modes.

## First slices

### Compiles today

- Mathematical and physical scalar constants (`pi`, `golden`, `c`, `h`, `hbar`, `G`, `elementary_charge`, `k`, `N_A`, `R`, `sigma`, ...) as module-level typed constants
- SI unit prefixes (`kilo` ... `quecto`) as constants
- Conversion kernels as `@vectorize` ufuncs: `convert_temperature`, `lambda2nu`, `nu2lambda`

### Blocked on compiler capabilities

File these as [postpython issues](https://github.com/openteams-ai/postpython/issues)
with minimal reproducers when you start on them — the filing is part of the
work and drives the compiler roadmap.

- `physical_constants` CODATA table plus `value()`/`unit()`/`precision()`/`find()` — needs Str-keyed containers (file a postpython issue with a reproducer when starting)

## Working rules (summary)

- Pure POST Python: no compiler-specific escape hatches; every kernel runs
  interpreted and compiled.
- `scipy` is the reference, never a runtime dependency. Tests may use it
  optionally; prefer deterministic hardcoded reference values.
- Compiler gaps go upstream as postpython issues with reproducers, not
  silent workarounds.
- Verify against a postpython checkout on `main`.
- Document accuracy targets and reference sources per function.

The full rules and the definition of done live in the
[PostSciPy roadmap](https://github.com/openteams-ai/postpython/blob/main/postscipy-roadmap.md).
